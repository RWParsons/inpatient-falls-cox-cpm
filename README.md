This repository contains the analyses code used to develop and evaluate a 
prognostic model for inpatient falls using data from the electronic medical 
records of patients admitted to Metro South hospitals.

It uses a [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) workflow that 
includes all model fitting, evaluation and generation of figures and tables
presented in the (forthcoming) publication.
