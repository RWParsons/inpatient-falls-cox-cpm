This repository contains the analyses code used to develop and evaluate
a prognostic model for inpatient falls using data from the electronic
medical records of patients admitted to Metro South hospitals.

It uses a [`{targets}`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) workflow
that includes all model fitting, evaluation and generation of figures
and tables presented in the (forthcoming) publication.
